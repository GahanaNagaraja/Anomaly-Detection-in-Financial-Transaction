# Anomaly-Detection-in-Financial-Transaction
A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach for Fraud Detection Using the PaySim Dataset

## Project Overview
This project applies statistical methods and machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent activities in mobile financial transactions using a synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim simulator. By combining exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, the project aims to uncover patterns associated with fraud and build reliable classification models to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Problem Statement
Fraudulent financial transactions pose a serious risk to digital banking systems. However, access to real-world data is often restricted due to privacy concerns. This project tackles the issue by utilizing a synthetic yet realistic dataset to investigate transaction behaviors, identify anomalies, and develop predictive models capable of classifying suspicious activity with high precision.

## Objectives

- Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the PaySim dataset

- Visualize transaction patterns through histograms, bar plots, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps

- Conduct statistical hypothesis testing (Chi-square, t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA)

- Estimate parameters using regression-based evaluation metrics

- Develop and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection

- Compare logistic regression and feed-forward neural network performance

## Data Source

Dataset: PaySim – Financial Transactions Simulator

- Records: 30 days of transaction simulation (744 time steps)

- Features (11 total):
step, type, amount, nameOrig, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, nameDest, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest, isFraud, isFlaggedFraud

- Target Variable: isFraud (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and standardized numeric features

- Encoded categorical variables and scaled imbalanced class distributions

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Computed summary statistics (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis)

- Visualized transaction frequencies, amounts, and class imbalance

- Plotted histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps

### Statistical Testing

- Chi-square test: Assessed dependency between isFraud and isFlaggedFraud

- t-test & Kruskal–Wallis test: Compared transaction attributes across fraud labels

- ANOVA: Evaluated the significance of numerical features in relation to fraud

### Parameter Estimation

- Calculated R², RMSE, and MSE for key variables to understand model fit and variance

### Correlation Analysis

- Constructed and visualized correlation matrix using Seaborn

- Analyzed linear relationships among financial variables

### Predictive Modeling

Logistic Regression

- Used as a baseline classifier for binary fraud detection

- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC

- Demonstrated solid performance for interpretable fraud prediction

Feed‑Forward Neural Network

- Built with ReLU activations, batch normalization, and dropout layers

- Trained using Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss

- Applied class balancing techniques (oversampling, weighted loss)

- Achieved superior performance in classification and generalization

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyTorch

- Statistical Tools: t-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis

- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Feed‑Forward Neural Network

## Key Outcomes

- Identified high-risk transaction types and behavior patterns linked to fraud

- Established statistically significant differences in transaction attributes between fraud and non-fraud classes

- Developed effective classification models for anomaly detection

- Logistic Regression offered simplicity and solid performance

- Feed‑Forward Neural Network achieved robust fraud detection with enhanced accuracy and recall

## Conclusion

This project successfully integrates statistical analysis with machine learning to detect anomalies in financial transactions. It highlights the value of synthetic data in training fraud detection systems and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining classical and neural approaches. The insights generated can aid financial institutions in refining fraud detection strategies while maintaining data privacy.
